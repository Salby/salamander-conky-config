This repo is for my conky configuration.

It uses the [conky_draw lua script](https://github.com/fisadev/conky-draw)

## Installation

**If you do not have conky installed on your system, make sure you do. Otherwise this won't work**

*If you're using ubuntu or any deriviate the command is __sudo apt-get install conky-all__*

Download the conky_draw.lua and conky_draw_config.lua from the repository linked to above.

Place the .conkyrc in your home directory. The conky_draw.lua and conky_draw_config.lua files should also be placed there.
Replace the blank Conky_draw_config.lua with the one you downloaded from my repository.

Open a terminal and type: conky
